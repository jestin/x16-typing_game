;==================================================
; Target strings are how we store the strings of
; targets.  Because we use sprites to display
; characters rather than relying on kernel string
; and character functions, the way we store them
; is quite a bit different from how you'd typically
; store strings.  First, we need to store a
; reference back to the actual string in program
; memory.  This is just a simple index that can
; be applied to string_map as an offset.  Next, we
; need to actually store a list of sprite indexes
; that are used to display this particular target
; string.  This list is terminated by a sentinel
; value that is larger than the X16's number of
; hardware sprites (128).
;
; The target strings are stored in memory as
; follows:
; ------------------------------------------------
; |00| String index                              |
; |01| Sprite index for the character            |
; | .| ""                                        |
; | .| ""                                        |
; | .| ""                                        |
; | N| Sentinel value (255 is best)              |
; ------------------------------------------------
;
; TODO - We will also need a special sprite index
; to represent spaces.  We don't want to waste
; hardware sprites for blank spaces that do not
; display.  Currently, this does not support spaces.
